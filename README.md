# Emotional-Well-being-Support
1. Developed a web application using Flask Framework to seamlessly integrate facial emotion detection and PHQ-9 questionnaire functionalities.
2. Leveraged Convolutional Neural Network techniques, initially constructing a seven-layered CNN model from scratch, achieving a commendable 65% validation accuracy. Transitioned to the VGG16 pretrained model elevating accuracy to 85%. Trained both the models on Kaggle’s Facial Emotion Recognition dataset.
3. Strategically integrated facial emotion analysis and PHQ-9 scores to assess an individual’s stress levels, classifying them into five different categories.
